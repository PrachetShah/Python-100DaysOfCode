# Learning Points & Summary
**Today's Learning Points**



* Use `.head()`, `.tail()`, `.shape` and `.columns` to explore your DataFrame and find out the number of rows and columns as well as the column names.

* Look for NaN (not a number) values with `.findna()` and consider using `.dropna()` to clean up your DataFrame.

* You can access entire columns of a DataFrame using the square bracket notation:` df['column name']` or `df[['column name 1', 'column name 2', 'column name 3']]`

* You can access individual cells in a DataFrame by chaining square brackets `df['column name'][index]` or using `df['column name'].loc[index]`

* The largest and smallest values, as well as their positions, can be found with methods like `.max()`, `.min()`, `.idxmax()` and `.idxmin()`

* You can sort the DataFrame with `.sort_values()` and add new columns with `.insert()`

* To create an Excel Style Pivot Table by grouping entries that belong to a particular category use the `.groupby()` method
